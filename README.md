# Security-Hardening-Project
In this project, I designed the infrastructure for a fictional bank, Starlings Savings. The report details the configuration of servers, patch management, and vulnerability mitigation strategies. I set up Windows Server environments and virtual machines, incorporating Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP roles to create a secure domain structure. The security hardening measures I implemented included enforcing strict password policies, creating limited‑privilege administrator accounts, disabling unnecessary services, and configuring firewall rules to protect sensitive ports. Regular updates and patches were installed to strengthen the bank's overall security posture. I also conducted a vulnerability assessment using tools such as Nmap, PowerShell, and Nessus to identify weaknesses in services and open ports. To ensure compliance with PCI DSS and NIST guidelines, I ensured that I closed any unnecessary ports.
